# Neuron-specific requirements for AWS Inferentia2
# Install these in addition to requirements.txt when running on Inferentia

# Note: These should be installed in the Neuron virtual environment:
# source /opt/aws_neuronx_venv_pytorch_2_8_nxd_inference/bin/activate

# The following are already in the Neuron venv:
# - neuronx-distributed-inference
# - torch (Neuron-optimized version)
# - transformers

# Additional requirements not in base requirements.txt:
# (none currently - all dependencies are satisfied by the Neuron venv)
