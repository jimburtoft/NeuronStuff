## 🔧 **Optimization Strategy**

Initial tests showed suboptimal performance due to:

1. **Small batch sizes** - Loading/unloading overhead dominated inference time
2. **Default precision settings** - Autocast enabled reduced precision
3. **Insufficient benchmarking** - Short tests didn't capture sustained performance
4. **Underutilization** - Small model not fully utilizing Neuron cores

## 🚀 **Actual Performance Results**

Testing on Neuron hardware with optimized configuration:

### Performance by Batch Size
- **Batch 512**: 1.37x speedup (3.2M samples/sec vs 2.3M CPU)
