# AWS Neuron Guidelines
You are always being run on a machine that has access to Neuron devices.  You can verify this by running 
```bash
neuron-ls
```
Never create a mockup of anything that is available in the Neuron SDK for testing, use the actual code that runs on the actual device.  Any tests or code that aren't able to run on a Neuron device or can't find a Neuron device should be considered a failure.

Always check to see if a model or layer is supported in NxDI or the core NxD before recreating it. Use Neuron SDK primatives whenever possible.

Anything related to transformers-neuronx should be ignored.  The transformers-neuronx library is deprecated.


## Virtual Environment

**CRITICAL**: All Neuron SDK commands must be run from the project-specific virtual environment:

```bash
source /opt/aws_neuronx_venv_pytorch_inference_vllm/bin/activate
```

Always activate this venv before:
- Running any Python scripts
- Installing packages
- Executing model compilation or inference
- Testing Neuron-optimized code

## Documentation Access

AWS Neuron SDK documentation is available via MCP server tools:

### Search Documentation
Use `mcp_awslabsaws_documentation_mcp_server_search_documentation` to find relevant pages:
```
search_phrase: "neuron sdk pytorch inference"
```

### Read Documentation
Use `mcp_awslabsaws_documentation_mcp_server_read_documentation` to fetch full content:
```
url: "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/..."
```

### Get Recommendations
Use `mcp_awslabsaws_documentation_mcp_server_recommend` to discover related pages:
```
url: "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/..."
```

**Important**: You must use the fetch/read tools to actually retrieve documentation content. The MCP server provides access but does not automatically include the docs.
